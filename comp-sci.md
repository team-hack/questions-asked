- What is a bit? A byte?
  - Bit = basic unit for holding computer information
  - Byte = holds 8 bits
- What is the difference between 8-bit and 16-bit? 32 bit, 64 bit? Why is 128 bit considered unnecessary?
  - Basically the answer here is word size of values (or addresses) that we can store
  - With 8 bit architecture, it was possible to have 256 values (2^8) we could represent as numbers, character sets, or even address lines.   In the 80s, we could have 256 different addresses with each line storing up to 1 byte of info (or 8 bits).  Later came 16 bit lines which made it possible to have 2^16 different addresses with 16 or even 32 bits (or up to 4 bytes) of info; presently we are on 64 bit architecture which means 2^64 different values (or 8 bytes of info) that can be addressed on gigabytes of memory (billions of bytes)-- huge memory; in fact so big we don’t need any more than that to do most common computing tasks in memory -- (not hard drive space, e.g. ROM).
  - Most processors are now running on 64 bit architecture, meaning that they can read blocks of 8 bytes at a time, even if the value isn’t necessarily that huge; the endianness of the value determines how the CPU reads the value (right to left or left to right)
- What is word length? What is a bus?
    - Word length refers to the size of a value / address / register
- The bus determines how much memory a CPU can read
- How does a CPU work? (See [simplecpu.com](https://simplecpu.com)) 
- What is the difference between int, long, short, float, decimal, char?
  - Different ways of storing bits, essentially each primitive stores a range of 2^8 to 2^64 bits.  Primitives can be copied directly (bits), however objects are references to bits that live on the garbage heap, which get collected if not used
- What is an unsigned int mean?  How about a signed int?
- What is an array? What is a string? Linked list?
- What is hexadecimal? How does it relate to binary? 
- Easy way to represent large binary numbers
- How to count in binary? Threes? Octal? Hex? Decimal?
- What is a kernel?  
- What is 1’s | 2’s complement? 
- What is a type? 
- What is a frame?
- What’s the main function do in C, C++, Java & C#?
- What is a shallow copy, and what is a deep copy? How do they differ?
- What is the stack?  
- What is the heap? (memory pool)?
- What is a heap data structure?
- What’s a min heap? A max heap?
- What’s the difference? 
  - Heaps are trees of information (e.g. max/min heaps) where data can reside (for collection later). 
  - Stacks hold things like function scopes, as we finish one frame, we pop it off a stack until we are done with all frames.   LIFO
  - Queues are FIFO, so great for traversing things like graphs/trees
- What is a stack overflow?
- What’s a reference?
- Syntactic sugar for getting an address in C++
- What is a pointer?
- Points to an address in memory
- How do you dereference a pointer? (Use the * symbol)
- Give examples of pointer usage
- Give examples of reference usage
- What is the benefit of using constant pointers? Constant references? Constant pointers to constants?
- What is a memory leak?
  - When we lose an address by destroying or overwriting a pointer to that memory
- What is a thread?  What is threading? 
  - Can be another stack of data that the CPU can run thru and give the idea of ‘multitasking’
- What is class abstraction? 
  - Classes that don’t get instantiated; makes no sense to implement but rather inherit from
- What’s a virtual function?
  - A function that is only for implementation, not actual use
- What is encapsulation? 
  - Keeping your private and public instance variables and methods safe from other classes / direct manipulation
- What is an enum?
  - Easy way to assign values to numbers for reference later
- What’s a struct?
  - Old way of defining classes (can’t do inheritance)
- What is a typedef?
- Define a type 
- What’s a template?
- A class / method that can take any type
- What is the std library?
- What’s a vector? 
- Like an arraylist in java
- What is function overloading?
- What is function overriding?
  - Overloading = Rewriting function to handle a different type
  - Overriding = Changing what a function does in a child class
- What is polymorphism? 
  - Allowing any object from its parent to child to work with another object’s function/method and producing different results
- What is an interface? (How does it differ from a class)?
  - Something that a class can use for methods/properties, but doesn’t interfere with inheritance
- What is OOP? Classes?
- What’s a constructor? What’s a destructor?
  - Constructors set up the classes to have initial values/state, destructors properly destroy all references to state values after class is no longer needed
- What’s the difference between a stream and cout?
- What’s a buffer?  How does it help with using a stream?
- What is a bit mask? 
  - Easy way to get values needed from a larger number (e.g. hex numbers)
- What’s a linked list? 
- What’s a hash, and how do you make one?
- What are trade-offs between arrays, vectors, linkedlists (or lists), and hashes?
- What is bit AND, bit OR, bit XOR? 
- What is a complement? 
- What is 1s complement, 2s complement?
- How do you read from files in Java? Python? Node.js?
- What is ASCII?  How does it differ from Unicode?
  - ASCII represents 256 different characters that match numbers 0 to 255, with 128 of them being alphanumeric characters.
  - Unicode represents way more combinations of letters/numbers including Chinese, Japanese, etc
