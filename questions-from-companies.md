- Answer from: 1) Programmatic standpoint; and 2) UX standpoint.

  - Rather than letting the whole app crash you can catch the error at the component level (using getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatchError)
  - Components have state. Redux has/is state. 
- When do you decide whether to use component state or redux state?
- When you want to move state out of single components 
- How do you change the parents' state from a child component? Pass a function as props and call it
