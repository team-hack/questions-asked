# Data Structures & Algorithms

- What is the concept of big O notation?
- What is an algorithm? Can you give a textbook definition? How about a real life definition?
- Explain the following for time / space complexity:
  - Linear
  - Quadratic
  - Constant
  - Factorial
  - Logarithmic
  - Exponential
- What is asymptotic notation?
- Explain the following thru code (or code samples), with time & space complexity:
  - Insertion sort
  - Merge sort
  - Quick sort
  - Binary search
- What does the term divide and conquer refer to?
- How do you calculate time complexity of a tree in recursion? (hint how do you get height and width)?
- What are some data structures you are familiar with?
- Can you implement any data structures using JavaScript or your favorite programming language?
  - Array
  - Linked List
  - Hash (Associative Array)
  - Binary Search Tree
  - Tree vs Tries
- Explain and give an example in code for each of the following:
  - Depth first search on a tree
  - Breadth first search on a tree
- Explain the following to me as if I were a 5 year old:
  - What is Dynamic Programming
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Bellman-Ford algorithm
  - Floyd Warshall algorithm
  - NP Completeness
- Why should companies care about Data Structures & Algorithms so much when it comes to writing software, having engineers who are good at these things? Why do you think Google cares so much?
